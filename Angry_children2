/* Bill Gates is on one of his philanthropic journeys to a village in Utopia.
He has brought a box of packets of candies and would like to distribute one packet to each of the children. 
Each of the packets contains a number of candies.
He wants to minimize the cumulative difference in the number of candies in the packets he hands out. 
This is called the unfairness sum. Determine the minimum unfairness sum achievable.*/
/*
Sample Input:

7
3
10
100
300
200
1000
20
30
Sample Output  :

40
Explanation :

Bill Gates will choose packets having 10, 20 and 30 candies. The unfairness sum is |10-20| + |20-30| + |10-30|=40 */
